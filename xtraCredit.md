I feel like with my healthcare background, I would find it easier to get into a healthtech company and hopefully command a higher salary, but looking at all the technologies these companies use and all the various roles within a company is a bit intimidating! Hoping our Outcomes team can help me navigate which role would be a good fit and which companies would be great to try to get into. 

This was a fun exercise =)
